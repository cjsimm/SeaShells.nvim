# SeaShells

A light/blue-toned color theme for neovim, implemented in Lua. Ported from the original [iterm2 seashells theme](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master). Includes an extra theme for Alacritty, copied from the [same project](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/alacritty/SeaShells.toml) for convenience

# Todo

- improve the colour choice for dark colours (not suitable for a transparent window)
- Fine tune the colours for every neovim element
- Begin implementing plugin colour overrides for popular plugins
    - telescope
    - nvim-cmp
    - treesitter
- take some hints from material nvim for some additional colours
- take some hints from material for some more advanced structure in the theme module


# Getting the theme into nvim

neovim seems to use the 'colorscheme' command


# The manual is your friend!

`:highlight` for list of customizable highlights
