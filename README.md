# SeaShells

A light/blue-toned color theme for neovim, implemented in Lua. Ported from the original [iterm2 seashells theme](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master). Includes an extra theme for Alacritty, copied from the [same project](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/alacritty/SeaShells.toml) for convenience
